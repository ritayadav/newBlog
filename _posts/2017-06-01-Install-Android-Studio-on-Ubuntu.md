Android Studio is the official IDE for Android. It’s open-source, distributed under the Apache license. This tutorial is going to show you how to install Android Studio on Ubuntu 16.04.


### Install Java 8 on Ubuntu 16.04

No matter which method you choose, you first need to install Java. It’s recommended to install Oracle Java, because it has a performance edge over OpenJDK. Run the following commands in terminal to install it from PPA.

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
{: .notice}
sudo apt-get update
{: .notice}
sudo apt-get install java-common oracle-java8-installer
{: .notice}

During the installation process you will need to accept the Oracle License agreement. Once installed we need to set Java environment variables such as

`JAVA_HOME` on Ubuntu 16.04.

sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-set-default
{: .notice}
source /etc/profile
{: .notice}

The above two commands will set the correct Java environment variables.
